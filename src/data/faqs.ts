 *   - Electrical insulating products (electrical-insulating-mats,
 *     coloured-strip-insulating-mats, bi-color-insulating-mats,
 *     auto-glow-reflective-band-insulating-mats) may reference
 *     IS 15652:2006, BIS Licence CM/L:8800129617, and ERDA/NTH test reports.
 *   - BharatMembrane must NOT inherit IS 15652, electrical insulation
 *     classes, the BIS insulating-mat licence, or ERDA/NTH electrical-mat
 *     claims. It references IS 15909:2020 conservatively.
 *   - Bharat Hydro Seal must NOT inherit IS 15652, electrical insulation
 *     classes, the BIS insulating-mat licence, or ERDA/NTH electrical-mat
 *     claims. It references IS 15058:2002 conservatively.
 *   - CPRI is NOT referenced anywhere. No CPRI document has been verified.
 *   - No claim is described as "BIS approval" unless a genuine
 *     product-specific approval document has been verified.

     - src/app/page.tsx (FAQStructuredData JSON-LD)
   Wording rules:
     - Electrical insulating mats reference IS 15652:2006 and
       BIS Licence CM/L:8800129617 and ERDA/NTH test reports.
     - Lead-time answers never invent exact timelines — they explain
       that timing depends on product, dimensions, quantity and
       delivery location, and should be confirmed during quotation.
     - BharatMembrane and Bharat Hydro Seal are clearly stated to be
       waterproofing/civil-protection products that do NOT inherit
       IS 15652:2006 insulating-mat certification.
