/**
 * Verified trust content — Bharat Electrosafe.
 *
 * Single source of truth for every credibility claim on the site, together
 * with the local path to the asset that evidences it.
 *
 * Rules this file exists to enforce:
 *
 *  - Nothing is stated more strongly than bharatelectrosafe.com states it.
 *    The source site uses "ERDA approved" in one place and "ERDA / NTH
 *    tested" in another; the conservative wording is used throughout, because
 *    no approval document has been supplied that would justify the stronger
 *    claim.
 *  - A logo is evidence that a mark exists, not that every product carries
 *    every claim. Marks without a released document get a label and no
 *    download control — never an invented certificate number or expiry.
 *  - No testimonials, order values, project descriptions, factory areas,
 *    capacities or headcounts appear anywhere. None are published by the
 *    source.
