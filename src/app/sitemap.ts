/**
 * Next.js Metadata API — sitemap.
 *
 * Contains all valid public routes: homepage, about, contact and
 * every product page. Uses the central site URL helper so that
 * every entry resolves against the official production domain.
 *
 * When indexing is disabled, returns an empty array so that no
 * misleading production URLs are exposed from staging/preview.
 *
 * lastModified is intentionally omitted — we do not falsely tell search
 * engines that every page changes on every deployment. If reliable
 * content-modification dates become available in future, they can be
 * added per-entry.
