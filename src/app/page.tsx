/**
 * Homepage metadata.
 *
 * Title: brand-last, hand-tuned for SEO (preserved per spec — "preserve
 * unique titles and descriptions already implemented on individual
 * pages").
 *
 * Description: mentions Bharat Hydro Seal explicitly, per spec —
 * "Do not remove Bharat Hydro Seal from the metadata."
 *
 * Open Graph image and Twitter image are NOT declared here. They are
 * auto-wired by Next.js App Router file conventions from
 * `src/app/opengraph-image.png` and `src/app/twitter-image.png`, with
 * alt text from the sibling `.alt.txt` files. Declaring `images`
 * here would override the file convention and lose the alt-text
 * companion.
 *
 * Title and description overrides remain so social platforms see the
 * hand-tuned SEO title and the Bharat-Hydro-Seal-inclusive description
 * rather than the more generic root default.
 *
 * FAQPage structured data is intentionally NOT emitted here. Spec
 * section 17: "Remove FAQPage structured data from this commercial
 * website. Google removed FAQ rich-result display in 2026, and
 * obsolete FAQ schema provides no meaningful search-result benefit
 * here." The visible FAQ accordion is retained for users.
