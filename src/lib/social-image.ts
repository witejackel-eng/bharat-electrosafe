/**
 * Centralised social-preview image metadata for Bharat Electrosafe.
 *
 * Two parallel copies of each social image exist:
 *   • `src/app/opengraph-image.png` and `src/app/twitter-image.png` —
 *     served at the site root by Next.js App Router file conventions
 *     (auto-emitted as <meta property="og:image"> / <meta name="twitter:image">).
 *   • `public/og/bharat-electrosafe-og-v2.png` and
 *     `public/og/bharat-electrosafe-twitter-v2.png` — explicit versioned
 *     copies served from /og/ with a `-v2` suffix so social-platform
 *     caches (which key on URL) are forced to re-fetch after a brand
 *     refresh. These are the URLs declared in `openGraph.images` /
 *     `twitter.images` so crawlers hit the versioned file directly.
 *
 * Both copies are byte-identical 1200×630 PNGs composed from the official
 * Bharat Electrosafe logo (left panel, navy background) and the approved
 * hero photograph of a technician at switchgear (right panel).
 *
 * Social image URLs always use the canonical domain (bharatelectrosafe.com)
 * so that preview/staging deployments never leak their *.vercel.app host
 * into social metadata. Next.js resolves relative URLs against metadataBase
 * (which is deploymentOrigin), but we provide absolute URLs here so the
 * domain is always canonical regardless of metadataBase.
 *
 * Routes that DO NOT have a product-specific social image should import
 * `siteOgImage` and `siteTwitterImage` and spread them into the route's
 * `openGraph` and `twitter` metadata objects. This guarantees every
 * route shares the same site-wide social card with accurate alt text —
 * Next.js does NOT auto-inherit the file-convention image to child
 * routes when the child route defines its own `openGraph` object
 * (even with `images` omitted), so explicit wiring is required.
