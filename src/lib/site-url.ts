/**
 * Central site URL helper — single source for all URL construction.
 *
 * Every canonical, sitemap entry, robots.txt host, Open Graph URL and
 * JSON-LD url field must route through this module. No component, page
 * or data file may build production URLs independently.
 *
 * ── canonicalOrigin vs deploymentOrigin ──
 *
 * The two concepts are deliberately separated:
 *
 *   • `canonicalOrigin` — the permanent public domain. Hardcoded to
 *     `https://bharatelectrosafe.com`. Used in canonical <link>,
 *     sitemap <loc>, robots host, JSON-LD url, Open Graph url. Never
 *     varies by deployment — even a preview deployment must claim the
 *     real public domain as its canonical so search engines consolidate
 *     ranking signals on the right URL.
 *
 *   • `deploymentOrigin` — the origin the current deployment is actually
 *     reachable at. Resolved from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, then
 *     `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL`, then `VERCEL_URL`, then the
 *     canonical origin as a final fallback. Used for metadataBase (so
 *     relative OG image URLs resolve against the deployment that
 *     actually serves them) and for the contact-form origin allow-list.
 *
 * On a production deployment where `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is set to the
 * canonical domain, the two are identical. On a preview deployment they
 * diverge — canonical stays on the real domain, deployment points at
 * `*.vercel.app`.
 *
 * ── Indexing guard ──
 *
 * Indexing is enabled ONLY when ALL of the following are true:
 *
 *   1. NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_INDEXING === 'true'
 *   2. The canonical origin is exactly https://bharatelectrosafe.com
 *      (always true — `canonicalOrigin` is hardcoded)
 *   3. The deployment is production (VERCEL_ENV === 'production'),
 *      or VERCEL_ENV is unset (local development / non-Vercel hosting
 *      where the operator is responsible for setting the env correctly)
 *
 * This prevents a preview deployment from becoming indexable even if
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_INDEXING=true is accidentally inherited from the
 * Production environment, because preview deployments have
 * VERCEL_ENV === 'preview' (condition 3 fails).

 *   4. canonicalOrigin                (final fallback so metadataBase is never empty)
